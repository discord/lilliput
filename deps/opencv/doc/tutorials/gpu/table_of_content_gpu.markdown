GPU-Accelerated Computer Vision (cuda module) {#tutorial_table_of_content_gpu}
=============================================

Squeeze out every little computation power from your system by using the power of your video card to
run the OpenCV algorithms.

    *Compatibility:* \> OpenCV 2.0

    This will give a good grasp on how to approach coding on the GPU module, once you already know
    how to handle the other modules. As a test case it will port the similarity methods from the
    tutorial @ref tutorial_video_input_psnr_ssim to the GPU.
