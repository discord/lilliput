Installation in Linux {#tutorial_linux_install}
=====================

These steps have been tested for Ubuntu 10.04 but should work with other distros as well.

Required Packages
-----------------

-   GCC 4.4.x or later
-   CMake 2.8.7 or higher
-   Git
-   GTK+2.x or higher, including headers (libgtk2.0-dev)
-   pkg-config
-   Python 2.6 or later and Numpy 1.5 or later with developer packages (python-dev, python-numpy)
-   ffmpeg or libav development packages: libavcodec-dev, libavformat-dev, libswscale-dev
-   [optional] libtbb2 libtbb-dev
-   [optional] libdc1394 2.x
-   [optional] libjpeg-dev, libpng-dev, libtiff-dev, libjasper-dev, libdc1394-22-dev
-   [optional] CUDA Toolkit 6.5 or higher

The packages can be installed using a terminal and the following commands or by using Synaptic
Manager:
@code{.bash}
[compiler] sudo apt-get install build-essential
[required] sudo apt-get install cmake git libgtk2.0-dev pkg-config libavcodec-dev libavformat-dev libswscale-dev
[optional] sudo apt-get install python-dev python-numpy libtbb2 libtbb-dev libjpeg-dev libpng-dev libtiff-dev libjasper-dev libdc1394-22-dev
@endcode
Getting OpenCV Source Code
--------------------------

You can use the latest stable OpenCV version or you can grab the latest snapshot from our [Git
repository](https://github.com/opencv/opencv.git).

### Getting the Latest Stable OpenCV Version

-   Go to our [downloads page](http://opencv.org/downloads.html).
-   Download the source archive and unpack it.

### Getting the Cutting-edge OpenCV from the Git Repository

Launch Git client and clone [OpenCV repository](http://github.com/opencv/opencv). If you need
modules from [OpenCV contrib repository](http://github.com/opencv/opencv_contrib) then clone it too.

For example
@code{.bash}
cd ~/<my_working_directory>
git clone https://github.com/opencv/opencv.git
git clone https://github.com/opencv/opencv_contrib.git
@endcode
Building OpenCV from Source Using CMake
---------------------------------------

-#  Create a temporary directory, which we denote as \<cmake_build_dir\>, where you want to put
    the generated Makefiles, project files as well the object files and output binaries and enter
    there.

    For example
    @code{.bash}
    cd ~/opencv
    mkdir build
    cd build
    @endcode
-#  Configuring. Run cmake [\<some optional parameters\>] \<path to the OpenCV source directory\>

    For example
    @code{.bash}
    cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local ..
    @endcode
    or cmake-gui

    -   set full path to OpenCV source code, e.g. /home/user/opencv
    -   set full path to \<cmake_build_dir\>, e.g. /home/user/opencv/build
    -   set optional parameters
    -   run: “Configure”
    -   run: “Generate”

    @note
    Use `cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local ..` , without spaces after -D if the above example doesn't work.

-#  Description of some parameters
    -   build type: `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release\Debug`
    -   to build with modules from opencv_contrib set OPENCV_EXTRA_MODULES_PATH to \<path to
        opencv_contrib/modules/\>
    -   set BUILD_DOCS for building documents
    -   set BUILD_EXAMPLES to build all examples

-#  [optional] Building python. Set the following python parameters:
    -   PYTHON2(3)_EXECUTABLE = \<path to python\>
    -   PYTHON_INCLUDE_DIR = /usr/include/python\<version\>
    -   PYTHON_INCLUDE_DIR2 = /usr/include/x86_64-linux-gnu/python\<version\>
    -   PYTHON_LIBRARY = /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libpython\<version\>.so
    -   PYTHON2(3)_NUMPY_INCLUDE_DIRS =
        /usr/lib/python\<version\>/dist-packages/numpy/core/include/

-#  [optional] Building java.
    -   Unset parameter: BUILD_SHARED_LIBS
    -   It is useful also to unset BUILD_EXAMPLES, BUILD_TESTS, BUILD_PERF_TESTS - as they all
        will be statically linked with OpenCV and can take a lot of memory.

-#  Build. From build directory execute make, recomend to do it in several threads

    For example
    @code{.bash}
    make -j7 # runs 7 jobs in parallel
    @endcode
-#  [optional] Building documents. Enter \<cmake_build_dir/doc/\> and run make with target
    "html_docs"

    For example
    @code{.bash}
    cd ~/opencv/build/doc/
    make -j7 html_docs
    @endcode
-#  To install libraries, from build directory execute
    @code{.bash}
    sudo make install
    @endcode
-#  [optional] Running tests

    -   Get the required test data from [OpenCV extra
        repository](https://github.com/opencv/opencv_extra).

    For example
    @code{.bash}
    git clone https://github.com/opencv/opencv_extra.git
    @endcode
    -   set OPENCV_TEST_DATA_PATH environment variable to \<path to opencv_extra/testdata\>.
    -   execute tests from build directory.

    For example
    @code{.bash}
    <cmake_build_dir>/bin/opencv_test_core
    @endcode

@note
   If the size of the created library is a critical issue (like in case of an Android build) you
    can use the install/strip command to get the smallest size as possible. The *stripped* version
    appears to be twice as small. However, we do not recommend using this unless those extra
    megabytes do really matter.
