As always, we would be happy to hear your comments and receive your contributions on any tutorial.

-   @subpage tutorial_table_of_content_introduction

    You will learn how to setup OpenCV on your computer!

-   @subpage tutorial_table_of_content_core

    Here you will learn
    the about the basic building blocks of the library. A must read and know for understanding how
    to manipulate the images on a pixel level.

-   @subpage tutorial_table_of_content_imgproc

    In this section
    you will learn about the image processing (manipulation) functions inside OpenCV.

-   @subpage tutorial_table_of_content_highgui

    This section contains valuable tutorials about how to use the
    built-in graphical user interface of the library.

-   @subpage tutorial_table_of_content_imgcodecs

    These tutorials show how to read and write images using imgcodecs module.

-   @subpage tutorial_table_of_content_videoio

    These tutorials show how to read and write videos using videio module.

-   @subpage tutorial_table_of_content_calib3d

    Although we got
    most of our images in a 2D format they do come from a 3D world. Here you will learn how to find
    out from the 2D images information about the 3D world.

-   @subpage tutorial_table_of_content_features2d

    Learn about how
    to use the feature points detectors, descriptors and matching framework found inside OpenCV.
