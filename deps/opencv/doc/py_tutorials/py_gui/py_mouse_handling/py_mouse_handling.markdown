Mouse as a Paint-Brush {#tutorial_py_mouse_handling}
======================

Goal
----

-   Learn to handle mouse events in OpenCV
-   You will learn these functions : **cv2.setMouseCallback()**

Simple Demo
-----------

Here, we create a simple application which draws a circle on an image wherever we double-click on
it.

First we create a mouse callback function which is executed when a mouse event take place. Mouse
event can be anything related to mouse like left-button down, left-button up, left-button
double-click etc. It gives us the coordinates (x,y) for every mouse event. With this event and
location, we can do whatever we like. To list all available events available, run the following code
in Python terminal:
@code{.py}
import cv2
events = [i for i in dir(cv2) if 'EVENT' in i]
print events
@endcode
Creating mouse callback function has a specific format which is same everywhere. It differs only in
what the function does. So our mouse callback function does one thing, it draws a circle where we
double-click. So see the code below. Code is self-explanatory from comments :
@code{.py}
import cv2
import numpy as np

# mouse callback function
def draw_circle(event,x,y,flags,param):
    if event == cv2.EVENT_LBUTTONDBLCLK:
        cv2.circle(img,(x,y),100,(255,0,0),-1)

# Create a black image, a window and bind the function to window
img = np.zeros((512,512,3), np.uint8)
cv2.namedWindow('image')
cv2.setMouseCallback('image',draw_circle)

while(1):
    cv2.imshow('image',img)
    if cv2.waitKey(20) & 0xFF == 27:
        break
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
@endcode
More Advanced Demo
------------------

Now we go for a much better application. In this, we draw either rectangles or circles (depending on
the mode we select) by dragging the mouse like we do in Paint application. So our mouse callback
function has two parts, one to draw rectangle and other to draw the circles. This specific example
will be really helpful in creating and understanding some interactive applications like object
tracking, image segmentation etc.
@code{.py}
import cv2
import numpy as np

drawing = False # true if mouse is pressed
mode = True # if True, draw rectangle. Press 'm' to toggle to curve
ix,iy = -1,-1

# mouse callback function
def draw_circle(event,x,y,flags,param):
    global ix,iy,drawing,mode

    if event == cv2.EVENT_LBUTTONDOWN:
        drawing = True
        ix,iy = x,y

    elif event == cv2.EVENT_MOUSEMOVE:
        if drawing == True:
            if mode == True:
                cv2.rectangle(img,(ix,iy),(x,y),(0,255,0),-1)
            else:
                cv2.circle(img,(x,y),5,(0,0,255),-1)

    elif event == cv2.EVENT_LBUTTONUP:
        drawing = False
        if mode == True:
            cv2.rectangle(img,(ix,iy),(x,y),(0,255,0),-1)
        else:
            cv2.circle(img,(x,y),5,(0,0,255),-1)
@endcode
Next we have to bind this mouse callback function to OpenCV window. In the main loop, we should set
a keyboard binding for key 'm' to toggle between rectangle and circle.
@code{.py}
img = np.zeros((512,512,3), np.uint8)
cv2.namedWindow('image')
cv2.setMouseCallback('image',draw_circle)

while(1):
    cv2.imshow('image',img)
    k = cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF
    if k == ord('m'):
        mode = not mode
    elif k == 27:
        break

cv2.destroyAllWindows()
@endcode

Exercises
---------

-#  In our last example, we drew filled rectangle. You modify the code to draw an unfilled
    rectangle.
