<p>In addition to being able to store simple image data, 
GIF files (specifically GIF89a files) allow for some special features. Tricks
such as transparency and animation can be accomplished with the 
help of the Graphics Control Extension block. Here's a sample of what this
block looks like:</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><img src="graphic_control_ext.gif"

<p>I'll show you how to manipulate the bytes in this block to achieve
special effects.</p>

<h2><a name="animation">Animation</a></h2>

<p>Cartoons are created by animators who draw a sequence of pictures,
each slightly different from the one before, which, when rapidly shown
one after the other, give the illusion of motion. Animation in GIF
images is achieved in much the same way. Multiple images may be stored
in the same file and you can tell the computer how much time to wait
before showing the next image. Let's walk though the parts that make
up this simple traffic light animation.

<p>This file is similar to  the ones we've previously encountered. The
bytes   start  out  with   the  GIF   header.  Next   we  have   a  <a
href="bits_and_bytes.html#logical_screen_descriptor_block">logical
screen descriptor</a> which  tells us that our image is  11px by 29 px
and will have  a global color table  with 8 colors in it  (of which we
only really need 5). Immediately after, follows the global color table
which  tells  us what  those  colors  are  (0=red, 1=green,  2=yellow,
3=light grey, 4=black, 5=white, 6=black [not used], 7=black [not used]
).</p>

<p>Next we encounter an <a
href="bits_and_bytes.html#application_extension_block">application
extension block</a>.  This is this block that causes our animation to
repeat rather than play once and stop. The first three bytes tell us
we are looking at (1) an extension block (2) of type
&quot;application&quot; which is followed by (3) 11 bytes of fixed
length data. These 11 bytes contain the ASCII character codes for
&quot;NETSCAPE2.0&quot;. Then begins the actual &quot;application
data&quot; which is contained in sub-blocks. There are two values that
are stored in these sub-blocks. The first value is always the byte
<span class="byte">01</span>. Then we have a value in the unsigned
(lo-hi byte) format that says how many times the animation should
repeat. You can see that our sample image has a value of 0; this means
the animation should loop forever. These three bytes are preceded by
the <span class="byte">03</span> that lets the decoder know that three
bytes of data follow, and they are terminated by <span
class="byte">00</span>, the block terminator.</p>

<p>This very basic animation is essentially made up of three different
&quot;scenes&quot;.  The first is the one with the green light lit,
the second with the yellow, and the last with the red. You should be
able to see three separate chunks of image data in the bytes
above. </p>

<table style="margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto">
	<tr><th>1</th><th>2</th><th>3</th></tr>
	<tr>
	<td><img src="sample_2_animation_green.gif" alt="scene 1: green light" width="11" height="29"/></td>
	<td><img src="sample_2_animation_yellow.gif" alt="scene 2: yellow light" width="11" height="29"/></td>
	<td><img src="sample_2_animation_red.gif" alt="scene 3: red light" width="11" height="29"/></td>
	</tr>
</table>

<p>The first chunk begins immediately after the application extension
block.  It is there we encounter our first graphic control
extension. As with all extensions, it begins with <span
class="byte">21</span>. Next, the type specific label for the graphic
control type of extension is <span class="byte">F9</span>. Next we see
the byte size of the data in the block; this should always be <span
class="byte">04</span>. The first of these four data blocks is a
packed field. </p>

<p>The packed field stores three values. The first three (highest)
bits are &quot;reserved for future use&quot; so those have been left
as zeros. The next three bits indicate the disposal method. The
<em>disposal method</em> specifies what happens to the current image
data when you move onto the next. We have three bits which means we
can represent a number between 0 and 7. Our sample animated image has
a value of 1 which tells the decoder to leave the image in place and
draw the next image on top of it. A value of 2 would have meant that
the canvas should be restored to the background color (as indicated by
the logical screen descriptor). A value of 3 is defined to mean that
the decoder should restore the canvas to its previous state before the
current image was drawn. I don't believe that this value is widely
supported but haven't had the chance to test it out. The behavior for
values 4-7 are yet to be defined. If this image were not animated,
these bits would have been set to 0 which indicates that do not wish
to specify a disposal method. The seventh bit in they byte is the
<em>user input flag</em>. When set to 1, that means that the decoder
will wait for some sort of &quot;input&quot; from the person viewing
the image before moving on to the next scene. I'm guessing it's highly
unlikeley that you will encounter any other value that 0 for this bit.
The final bit is the transparency flag. We will go into more detail
about transparency in <a href="#transparency">the next
section</a>. Since this image isn't using any transparency, we see
this bit has been left at 0. </p>

<p>The next two bytes are the delay time. This value is in the same
unsigned lformat as all the other integers in the file. This number
represents the number of hundredths of a second to wait before moving
on to the next scene. We see that our sample image has specified
a value of 100 (<span class="byte">64</span> <span class="byte">00</span>)
in the first graphics control block which means we would wait 1 second 
before changing our green light to yellow.</p>

<p>Our graphics control extension block ends with the block
terminator <span class="byte">00</span>. You will notice this
type of block appearing two more times in this image, the second
instance differing only in the delay time (the yellow light only 
stays up for half a second).</p>

<p>The next chunk is an image descriptor. The block declares that it
will be drawing an image starting at the top left corner and taking up
the whole canvas (11px x 29px). This block is followed by the image
data that contains all the codes to draw the first scene, the one with
the green light on.</p>

<table style="margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto; text-align: center">
	<tr><th>Green</th><th>(Difference)</th><th>Yellow</th></tr>
	<tr>
	<td><img src="sample_2_green_large.gif" alt="green light enlarged" width="33" height="87"/></td>
	<td><img src="sample_2_green_yellow_diff.gif" alt="difference between green and yellow images"width="33" height="87"/></td>
	<td><img src="sample_2_yellow_large.gif" alt="yellow light enlarged" width="33" height="87"/></td>
	</tr>
</table>

<p>If we compare the first and the second scene, we see they share many
of the same pixel color values. Rather than redrawing the whole canvas,
we can specify just the part that changes (that is, the smallest
rectangle that covers the part that changes). You'll see that the 
image descriptor before the second block of image data specifies
that it will start at the pixel at (2, 11) and draws a box that's 
7px wide by 16px tall. This is just large enough to cover the bottom two
lights. The works because we chose the &quot;do not dispose&quot; disposal
method for out graphics control extension block. In the same way,
the third and final image data block only renders the top two circles
to both fill in the red and cover up the yellow.</p>
	
<h2><a name="transparency">Transparency</a></h2>

<p>Normally, GIF images are rectangles that cover up what ever
background may be beneath them. Transparency allows you to &quot;see
though&quot; the image to whatever is below. This is a very simple
trick to pull off in a GIF image. You can set up one color in your
color table that is converted to &quot;invisible ink.&quot; Then, as
the image is drawn, whenever this special color is encountered, the
background is allowed to show through.</p>

<p>There are only two pieces of data we have to set to pull this
off. First we must set the Transparency Color Flag to 1. This is the
lowest bit in the packed byte of the Graphic Control Extension. This
will tell the decoder that we want our image to have a transparent
component.  Secondly we must tell the decoder which color we want to
use as our invisible ink. The decoder will then all you to see thought
every pixel that contains this color. Therefore make sure it's not a
color that you are using else where in your image. The color you
choose must be in the active color table and you specify its value in
the Transparent Color Index byte by setting this value to the index of
the color in the color table.</p>

<p>Let's demonstrate this by revisiting the sample image we used
in <a href="bits_and_bytes.html">Bits and Bytes</a>. We will update this
file to make the white center part transparent. Let's start creating
the Graphic Control Extension block that will do this for us. Again we 
start with the <span class="byte">21</span> <span class="byte">F9</span>
<span class="byte">04</span> punch. In the next byte, we need to flip
the transparent color flag to 1 (we can leave the others at zero) so 
this whole byte is simply <span class="byte">01</span>. The next two 
bytes can be left at zero.</p>

<p>We must now specify which color to disappear.  Recall that our
sample image had the following global color table:</p>

<table style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto">
	<tr><th>Index</th><th>Color</th></tr>
	<tr><td>0</td><td><span style="color:#FFFFFF; background: #000000; font-weight: bold">White</span></td></tr>
	<tr><td>1</td><td><span style="color:#FF0000; font-weight: bold">Red</span></td></tr>
	<tr><td>2</td><td><span style="color:#0000FF; font-weight: bold">Blue</span></td></tr>
	<tr><td>3</td><td><span style="font-weight: bold">Black</span></td></tr>
</table>

<p>We already know what we want to make all the white sections
transparent.  The color white has an index of 0. Therefore we will
specify a value of <span class="byte">00</span> for the transparent
color index block.  Had we wanted to make the red transparent we would
have used <span class="byte">01</span>, or <span
class="byte">02</span> for blue.  Lastly we tack on the block
terminator of <span class="byte">00</span> and we're done. We have
created the following block:</p>

<p>
<span class="byte gif_graphic"> 21 </span>
<span class="byte gif_graphic"> F9 </span>
<span class="byte gif_graphic"> 04 </span>
<span class="byte gif_graphic"> 01 </span>
<span class="byte gif_graphic"> 00 </span>
<span class="byte gif_graphic"> 00 </span>
<span class="byte gif_graphic"> 00 </span>
<span class="byte gif_graphic"> 00 </span>
</p>

<p>Now, all we have to do is plug this into our sample image right before the
image descriptor. I've placed our original sample image on a black background
as well as the one we just made so you can see the results. I've also included
ones where red or blue are transparent. The last three differ by only the 
transparent color index byte.</p>

<table cellpadding="10px" style="text-align: center; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto">
<tr>
<th style="width:25%">Original</th>
<th style="width:25%">Transparent <br/>
White (<span class="byte">00</span>)</th>
<th style="width:25%">Transparent <br/>
Red (<span class="byte">01</span>)</th>
<th style="width:25%">Transparent <br/>
Blue (<span class="byte">02</span>)</th>
</tr>
<tr>
