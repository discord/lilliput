<p>These pages explain down
to the bit level what's inside a GIF, and are offered in the hope they
will be useful to programmers using GIFLIB.</p>

<p>The explanation is in three parts:<p>

<ol>
<li><a href="bits_and_bytes.html">Bits and Bytes</a> - first we look at the
file format that makes up a GIF file</li>
<li><a href="lzw_image_data.html">LZW Image Data</a> - a closer 
look at how image data is compressed within a GIF file</li>
<li><a href="animation_and_transparency.html">Transparency and Animation</a> - 
how some of the more advanced features of GIF files work</li>
</ol>
</div>

<p>Due credit: much of this material was written by one Mike
Flickinger in 2005, though it has been significantly revised and
expanded for GIFLIB. The illustrations are all his.</p>
