This directory contains documentation on the API and tools. 
The most convenient way to view it is with a browser pointed
at the project website, but...

An introduction to the package is in intro.xml

API documentation lives in gif_lib.xml

gif89.txt and lzgif.txt are the relevant format and compression standards.

For completeness, the original GIF87 specification is also included as
gif87.txt.
